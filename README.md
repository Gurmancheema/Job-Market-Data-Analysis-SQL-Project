# Job Market Data Analysis SQL-Project 💼📊
# Introduction 🌟
This project focuses on analyzing a Job Market Dataset 📊 to uncover trends, insights, and valuable metrics 📈 for job seekers 🧑‍💼 & recruiters 🤝. The objective was to understand various factors influencing job availability 💼, required skills 🛠️, salary ranges 💰, and demand across industries 🌍.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my skills in SQL-based data analysis 🗂️ while deriving actionable insights 🔍 from real-world datasets 📂.

# Background 🧐
I analyzed a dataset representing various job roles, industries, locations, salary ranges, and skill requirements.
The insights gained could be used to:
🎯 Recognize in-demand skills and industries.
💰 Identify trends in salary distributions by location and role.
🗺️ Understand geographical hotspots for opportunities.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
